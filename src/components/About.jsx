            and I love building elegant

                A little bit more about me, I've been passionate about 
                web development and started to carve my path back in 
                2016 when I bought my first domain name. Since then I've
                dabbled in free courses and started to learn on my own but
                I never took the plunge until Covid-19 hit our world like a 
                wrecking ball. This is when I took an opportunity to go fulltime
                into my knowledge and joined a bootcamp. After finishing this bootcamp
                I began build more and more projects fueling my passion.
